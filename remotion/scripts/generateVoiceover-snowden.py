This building was secretly collecting your calls.
Your emails.
Your photos.
For six years.
Without ever telling you.

His name is Edward Snowden.
29 years old.
CIA trained.
NSA credentialed.
He had seen things the government never wanted you to know.

March 2013.
Congress asked the Director of National Intelligence directly.
Is the NSA collecting data on millions of Americans?
His answer.
Under oath.
To Congress.
No.
It was a lie.

This is the classified document he leaked.
Nine companies.
Microsoft.
Google.
Facebook.
Apple.
... ...
Your email.
Your photos.
Your calls.
Marked Top Secret.
Never meant to be seen.

The NSA asked itself why it needed access to all internet traffic.
Its own answer.
Because nearly everything you do online uses HTTP.
All of it.
Everyone.
Always.

Snowden fled.
The U.S. canceled his passport while he was in the air.
He landed in Moscow.
He couldn't leave.
He is still there today.

In 2020 a federal court ruled it was illegal.
The men who lied to Congress were never charged.
Not one.
Comment below.
Follow the channel.
