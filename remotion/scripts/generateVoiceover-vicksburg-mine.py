    # was tried first per the original fallback plan but introduced a much worse
    # ~437ms gap around "open" that survived multiple respelling attempts, so it was
    # abandoned in favor of this smaller, targeted fix. "blewa"/"footcrater" fix
    # separate word-boundary pauses (measured via ffmpeg silencedetect: 361ms and
    # 220ms vs. ~85-90ms for normal word gaps). All verified via silencedetect on
    # the actual rendered take, not just duration.
